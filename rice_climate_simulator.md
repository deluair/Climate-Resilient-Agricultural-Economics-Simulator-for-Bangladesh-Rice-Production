# Climate-Resilient Agricultural Economics Simulator for Bangladesh Rice Production

## Executive Summary

### Critical Problem Statement
Bangladesh, one of the world's most climate-vulnerable nations, faces an agricultural crisis that threatens the livelihoods of 158 million people who depend on rice as their staple food. Rice provides 74% of total calorie intake and occupies 80% of the net cropped area, yet maximum temperature negatively affects all three rice varieties, with climate change expected to reduce overall rice production by 7.4% annually through 2050. Progressive salinization threatens 30% of cultivable coastal land, with soil salinity exceeding 4 dS/m causing 15.6% output decline in nine coastal sub-districts before 2050. This simulation addresses the urgent need for integrated climate-economic modeling specific to Bangladesh's unique three-season rice system and complex socio-economic vulnerabilities.

### Simulation Objectives
Develop a comprehensive Python-based agent-based model that captures the intricate relationships between Bangladesh's monsoon-dependent climate system, three-season rice production cycles (Aus, Aman, Boro), farmer economic decision-making under extreme constraints, and policy interventions in one of the world's most densely populated and climate-vulnerable agricultural economies.
